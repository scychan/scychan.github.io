I'm a Staff Research Scientist at Google DeepMind. I work primarily in two areas:
1. **Science of AI, especially in-context learning**. I try to understand AI systems as an object of study, much as we might try to understand the brain. A lot of my work focuses on understanding in-context learning in transformers.
2. **AI to empower humans**. I believe that AI can be used to augment human potential and human capital, e.g. via education, if we do it responsibly and inclusively.

I previously led small research teams at AI-based startups in Boston/Barcelona/Hong Kong. My PhD was in computational neuroscience at Princeton, focusing on reinforcement learning and episodic memory. At MIT, I did a BS in physics and a BS in brain and cognitive sciences.
