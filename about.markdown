I'm currently a Staff Research Scientist at Google Deepmind. My current research revolves around two key themes:
* The science of understanding modern AI models, much as we would try to understand the brain as an object of study. A lot of this work focus on in-context learning in transformers.
* Using AI to empower humans, e.g. through education.

Before joining Google / DeepMind, I led small research teams at AI-based startups based in Boston, Barcelona, and Hong Kong. I did my PhD in computational neuroscience at Princeton, and at MIT a BS in physics and a BS in brain and cognitives sciences.
